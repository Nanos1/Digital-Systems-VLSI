# Digital-Systems-VLSI
Lab exercises of Digital VLSI Systems course in NTUA.

For the laboratory exercises in the course we developed digital systems by using Hardware Description Language (VHDL). We developed and analysed techniques, design methodologies and tools for reducing and estimating power consumption for each design level, during the implementation of VLSI circuits for arithmetic operations, digital filters and circuits based on special numerical systems for high-speed application.
